        SCAM Development Platform is intended to be used as a basis 
        for building repositories for the Semantic Web. The idea is that SCAM 
        provides a stable and scalable solution that is capable of storing RDF 
        data in a relational databases without demanding a lot of programming. 
        SCAM hides the complexity of Semantic Web technology, and provides a 
        highly adaptable and flexible out-of-the box solution for developing 
        Semantic Web repositories with a minimum of development efforts and 
        resources. SCAM can also be integrated or even embedded into other 
        systems that are in need of advanced RDF functionality.
