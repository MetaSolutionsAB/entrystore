# EntryStore [![Build Status](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/metasolutions/entrystore/status.png)](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/metasolutions/entrystore/latest)

EntryStore is the reference implementation of the Resource and Metadata Management Model (ReM3). ReM3 is an information model for keeping track of resources and their metadata and provides a unique approach to information management. It allows web pages, physical objects, abstract concepts, events, etc. to be described by established metadata standards and to be managed in a single system.

So called "entries" are used for handling resources and their various metadata graphs, and to keep track of administrative information. EntryStore is completely built around entries for managing all information, therefore also the name.

EntryStore is the new name for the SCAM (Standardized Contextualized Access to Metadata) framework.
