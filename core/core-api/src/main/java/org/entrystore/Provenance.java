/**
 * Maintains the provenance, that is, a revision history for various parts
 * of an entry according to the prov ontology.
 * The revisions are recorded as entities, currently only metadata entities
 * are supported, but support for revisions to the resource and the
 * entry information may be added.
 *
 * The expression is encoded in the entry graph where each entity is described
 * with the following properties:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>prov:wasRevisionOf - pointing to the previous revision (if any)</li>
 *     <li>prov:wasAttributedTo - pointing to the resource URI of the user causing the revision</li>
 *     <li>prov:generatedAtTime - providing the date of change</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The latest metadata entity (revision) points to the current metadata URI
 * via owl:sameAs. The URI of each metadata entity is constructed from the local
 * metadata URI with a "?rev=nr" appended where nr is 1 for the first revision
 * and then incremented for each revision.
