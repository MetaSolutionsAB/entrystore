This project is a test client to the SCAM sqi-webservice project.
To try it out, follow this steps:
1. Setup the webservice
 1.1 Modify wsdl
   change the soap:address location in
   /modules/sqi/sqi-webservice/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wsdl/sqiTarget.wsdl
   /modules/sqi/sqi-webservice/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wsdl/sqiSessionManagement.wsdl
   to location where you intend to deploy the sqi webservices.
   (example http://localhost:8080/scam-sqi-webservice-module-4.0-SNAPSHOT/services/SqiTargetService)
 1.2 Build
   % cd /modules/sqi/sqi-webservice
   % mvn clean install
 1.3 Deploy  
   Deploy target/scam-sqi-webservice-module-4.0-SNAPSHOT.war to location you specified in 1.1

3. Run client
 1.1 Build
   % cd /modules/sqi/sqi-webservice-client
   % mvn clean install
 1.2 Run the client code
   % mvn  exec:exec. 
 
Explanation: 
 This pom file in the sqi-webservice project generates the JAX-WS artifacts (using CXF's wsdl2java) that will 
 be used by the web service provider and the test client. It also creates the WAR file that will host the web service.
 The Maven Assembly Plugin (also in pom file in the sqi-webservice project) is used here to create an additional
 JAR artifact containing just the JAX-WS objects above. This artifact is included as a dependency in the the test client module's pom.xml file.
